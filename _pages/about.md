Currently I am leading deep learning efforts at [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com) where we are building algorithms that power the smartest flying robot in the world. We have several [deep learning](https://boards.greenhouse.io/skydio/jobs/4221006003) [related](https://boards.greenhouse.io/skydio/jobs/4650571003) [open positions](https://boards.greenhouse.io/skydio/jobs/4544846003) on our team.

I finished my PhD studies at the University of Adelaide in 2020. I was fortunate to work there under the supervision of [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) and co-supervision of [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io). During my doctorate studies I used deep learning to solve various dense per-pixel computer vision tasks (primarily, semantic segmentation) in real-time and with high performance. My doctorate thesis is available through [the University of Adelaide library service](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/129333).

I believe in hard work and curious mind.
