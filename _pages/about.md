*Hello! I am Vladimir and I occasionally write posts here on a variety of topics that I am interested in. Just like the solyanka soup, this blog contains a mixture of everything, hence its name.*

### About me

My primary experience is in applied deep learning and computer vision. I have worked across the full stack of machine learning stages, including working with raw data and setting up (multi-node) infrastructure for training / validation / deployment. My programming language of choice is Python (although occasionally I also write in C++ and CUDA if needed) and my deep learning framework of choice is PyTorch (although I have worked with TensorFlow and [some of my past work is still quite popular](https://github.com/DrSleep/tensorflow-deeplab-resnet)). For deployment purposes, I have primarily worked with [TensorFlow.js](https://drsleep.github.io/tutorial/Tutorial-PyTorch-to-TensorFlow-JS/) and TensorRT.

Previously I was a senior data scientist of the AI team at Nearmap, where I was building temporal deep learning solutions on aerial imagery.

Before that, I was leading deep learning efforts and managing a small team at Skydio, where I was building end-to-end reproducible and easily extendable deep learning pipelines for various vision-based tasks.

I did my PhD studies at the University of Adelaide. I was fortunate to work there under the supervision of [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) and co-supervision of [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io). During my doctorate studies I used deep learning to solve various dense per-pixel computer vision tasks (primarily, semantic segmentation) in real-time and with high performance. My doctorate thesis is available through [the University of Adelaide library service](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/129333). As a PhD student, I was the first author of 6 academic papers, 5 of which were published and presented at major computer vision and robotic conferences, including CVPR and ICRA.

I believe in hard work and curious mind.

### Hobbies

My major hobby is European football (known to some by an [s-word](https://youtu.be/S0XAgVlhAE4?t=20)) and my favourite team is Liverpool FC. I have been supporting Liverpool since 2007 and so far have been fortunate to see them twice with my own eyes (both times losing, so I might be an unlucky charm :flushed:).

My other hobbies include reading books, watching movies and listening to music.
