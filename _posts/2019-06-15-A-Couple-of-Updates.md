1. I am currently in Long Beach attending CVPR 2019, where we are going to present our paper on fast neural architecture search for semantic segmentation -- transferrable to other dense per-pixel tasks such as depth estimation and pose estimation. The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10804) and the models have been released [here](https://github.com/DrSleep/nas-segm-pytorch). Notably, we used only 8 (!) GPU-days to find compact architectures that outperform DeepLab-v3+. 
If you are attending CVPR and interested in our work, please come over to our poster #18 on Thursday, June 20, 2019 from 10am until 12.45 (poster stand 3.1). In next few weeks, I will publish a more detailed overview of the paper.

2. I am also excited to join the [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/) autonomy team as an intern! Thrilled and looking forward to eventful few months ahead!
