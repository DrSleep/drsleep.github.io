***Last month the creator of the [HydraNets course on multi-task learning](https://courses.thinkautonomous.ai/hydranets) Jeremy Cohen reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in speaking with him about how our own [multi-task learning research](https://drsleep.github.io/technical/Real-Time-Joint-Segmentation-Depth-and-Surface-Normals-Estimation/) came to life and what sort of challenges deep learning researchers are usually faced with.***

Our conversation lasted for about half an hour and we mostly covered how Multi-Task Light-Weight RefineNet was created and what goes into the process of writing and publishing a research paper.
